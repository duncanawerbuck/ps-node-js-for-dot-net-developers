As per Shawn Wildermuth's Pluralsight Course "Node.js for .NET Developers"

Up to 02:27 of "Client-side Socket.io" ("Real-time Communication with Node.js" module).

Not sure why we're not getting the additional debug info - perhaps we should be using an older version of either socket.io or socket.io-cli.
